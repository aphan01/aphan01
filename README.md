## Introduction

👋 Hi there, my name is **An** (pronounced like “Ant” without the “t”) and I’m a **Junior Computer Engineering student** interested in building software projects while learning new technologies!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Finsaction**, a multi-tenant billing SaaS platform built with **Django REST, PostgreSQL, and Docker**, focusing on payment automation and tenant-level data isolation.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Spring Boot, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines** to deepen my backend and infrastructure skills.  
- 👯 I’m eager to **join teams where I can contribute to real-world software development**, learn from experienced engineers, and grow as a backend or full-stack intern.  
- 🌍 Outside of coding, I’m a big **soccer fan** and a dedicated **gamer**!  
- 📫 Feel free to reach me via [email](mailto:aphan01@villanova.edu) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/an-phan-85b498273).
